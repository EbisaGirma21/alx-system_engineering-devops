**Issue Summary:**

**Duration:** July 15, 2023, 08:00 AM - July 15, 2023, 11:30 AM (UTC)

**Impact:** The web application experienced a service outage, rendering it unavailable to users. Approximately 25% of users were affected during the outage, leading to a significant loss in user engagement and potential revenue.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a database connection pool exhaustion. This was due to a gradual accumulation of idle connections that were not being properly closed, eventually causing the pool to reach its limit and preventing new connections from being established.

**Timeline:**

- **08:00 AM:** The issue was detected by an automated monitoring alert that indicated a sudden increase in response times and a spike in error rates.
- **08:10 AM:** The engineering team initiated an investigation, focusing on the application servers and load balancers.
- **08:30 AM:** Initial assumption was that the load balancer might be misconfigured, leading to uneven distribution of requests. Load balancer configuration was thoroughly reviewed and found to be correct.
- **09:00 AM:** Further investigation revealed that the application servers were running at normal capacity, and the issue might be related to the database.
- **09:30 AM:** A mistaken assumption was made that the database was overutilized, leading to scaling up of database instances to handle the increased load.
- **10:00 AM:** With the database scaled up, the issue persisted. It was then realized that the root cause might be in the application's handling of database connections.
- **10:30 AM:** Debugging paths were refocused towards the application code. Analysis revealed that the database connection pool was being exhausted.
- **11:00 AM:** Incident was escalated to the database team for further investigation.
- **11:30 AM:** The database team identified the idle connection accumulation issue and implemented a fix to close idle connections after a specified period of inactivity, restoring normal operation.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

**Root Cause:** The application was not properly managing idle database connections in its connection pool. This led to a gradual buildup of connections over time, causing the connection pool to reach its limit and prevent new connections.

**Resolution:** The database team implemented a code fix that periodically checked for and closed idle connections after they had been inactive for a set duration. This prevented the connection pool from becoming exhausted and allowed new connections to be established.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

**Improvements/Fixes:**

1. **Connection Pool Management:** Implement a more robust connection pool management strategy, including regular monitoring of connection usage and implementing automated routines to close idle connections.
2. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect unusual spikes in database connection usage and response times.
3. **Load Testing:** Regularly conduct load testing to simulate heavy usage scenarios and identify potential bottlenecks before they impact production.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

1. **Deploy Code Fix:** Roll out the code fix that automatically closes idle database connections after a specific period of inactivity.
2. **Database Optimization:** Review and optimize database queries to reduce the overall load on the database and minimize connection usage.
3. **Documentation Update:** Update documentation for developers to include best practices for managing database connections and connection pool resources.

In conclusion, the outage was caused by a database connection pool exhaustion due to idle connection accumulation. Swift identification of the root cause, along with timely escalation and effective collaboration between teams, enabled the issue to be resolved within a few hours. The incident highlighted the importance of robust connection pool management and the need for continuous monitoring and improvement of application performance.
